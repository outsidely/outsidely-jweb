            <h3>
                What is Outsidely?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Outsidely is a rudimentary activity tracker for those who are more interested in just getting
                outside than they are in their training or stats.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What is Outsidely not?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Outsidely isn't and won't ever be a replacement for feature rich fitness trackers like Strava and Garmin Connect.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Creating Activities
            </h3>
            <p>
                Activities can be added manually, or GPX files can be uploaded.
                Almost all major devices and apps support exporting as GPX directly. Many only do through their websites and not
                their mobile apps. Strava, for example, can export GPX files once data is synchronized there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, companies like Garmin, Wahoo, Coros, and Suunto do not provide public API access for users and their data.
                This means that it isn't possible to automatically sync activities from devices.
